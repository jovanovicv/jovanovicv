Registering in IRR and RPKI Databases
The Internet Routing Registry (IRR) is a globally distributed collection of databases used to register routing information and publish routing policies. Network operators register their BGP announcements in IRR databases that are used by other networks to create BGP filters and make informed routing decisions.

Because there are Network Operators that specifically rely on IRR to create filters (more details under "Route Filtering" below), enterprises that don't register resources in IRR may fail to establish desired BGP peerings. Also, consider that if a network operator fails to register their Internet resources or updates them incorrectly, it can result in BGP misconfigurations and disruptions to Internet connectivity.

The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a system for verifying the authenticity of Internet routing information. By registering Internet resources in RPKI, network operators can create cryptographic signatures that validate the legitimacy of their routing information.

Routers receiving BGP updates can use these signatures to validate the routing information's authenticity and prevent malicious route hijacks. Registering Internet resources in RPKI is crucial to prevent accidental misconfigurations and deliberate attacks on BGP routing, improving the security and stability of the Internet routing system.
