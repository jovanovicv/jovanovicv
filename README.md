ROV (RPKI Origin Validation RFC8481) is a security mechanism that enhances the security of BGP routing by providing a way to cryptographically validate the origin of BGP route announcements. To implement ROV, network operators must first register their Internet resources into the RPKI system and create a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) record for each prefix they advertise to the Internet. The ROA record contains information about the prefix and the autonomous system (AS) that is authorized to originate it.
